Webscraping critic concert reviews

This project was developed to webscrape critic reviews from different music media website, to use in a concert app called Tribute. Information includes text, review, author, artist name, venue name, published date and concert date. Each scraper is taylored to each site, as information such as venue name, might be hidden as a sepearte tag or needed to be extracted from a headline etc. A Spotify API lookup is made on every artist name to find additional information.
