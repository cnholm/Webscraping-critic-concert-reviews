      "Headline: Recital turns rave as fans embrace one last gig\n",
      "Text: Sunday evening and the atmosphere in Brighton Dome feels curiously subdued. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that you can’t escape current events. Jon Hopkins’ most recent album, 2018’s Singularity, unexpectedly made the Top 10. This sold-out gig is nevertheless pockmarked with empty seats. There seems every chance that this is the last concert anyone here will be going to for the foreseeable future, but some ticket holders have clearly decided that even that isn’t incentive enough to leave home.  Or perhaps a muted atmosphere generally prevails at gigs by Hopkins, a sometime Coldplay and Brian Eno collaborator whose music exists at a distinctly cerebral nexus where contemporary classical meets soundtrack-y ambience and egghead techno that would once have earned the frightful generic label intelligent dance music. It’s where profile-boosting appearances on Spotify curated playlists called things such as 4am Chillout and Atmospheric Calm meet generative sound installations. Initially, this feels more like a recital than a gig. An anonymous figure in a white T-shirt, Hopkins sits hunched over a grand piano on a dark stage, playing the beautiful, fluttering figures of recent single Scene Suspended. The sound is augmented first by electric guitar so densely affected that what the guitarist is doing with his hands seems to bear no relation to what’s coming out of the speakers, then by cello and violin, the latter producing odd, wheezing drones.  The audience listen in reverential silence: there’s a degree of shushing and eye-rolling when people venture from their seats to the bar or the toilets. Occasionally, the music is enough to drown them out, swelling from charming fragility to something more muscular: at one point, the guitar swamps everything with fizzing noise that seems to pan from one side of the room to the other.     ‘The volume of the roar when it ends seems to take him aback’ … Jon Hopkins. Photograph: Tabatha Fireman/The Guardian    When Hopkins shifts from piano to the bank of electronics at the rear of the stage, the effect is intriguing. The mid-tempo chug of Cosm provokes a solitary audience member out of her seat: she dances with the dogged self-consciousness you always see in people who get on their feet at a seated gig, only to discover no one else has followed suit. The next time Hopkins abandons the baby grand, however, what emerges from his laptop is more forceful. The criticism occasionally levelled at his music – that it’s too eggheaded and painstakingly thought through to connect with on a visceral level – makes no sense live. Every sound seems to come with added heft, the bass feels more central and pulverising and the beats more linear, less inclined to clatter.   Related: Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras    It makes a visible impression. There’s a kind a ripple effect in the audience as more people get up until the entire crowd is dancing. As Hopkins ratchets up the intensity and the subtle lighting is replaced by blinding white flashes and strobes, it’s hard not to feel that there’s an oddly moving and powerful sense of gleeful catharsis and escapism in their reaction. People who were listening intently a few minutes ago are now whooping and yelling when the bass drops. The volume of the roar when it ends seems to take Hopkins aback: he stands on stage and applauds the crowd.  A Sunday evening recital has unexpectedly turned into something approximating a rave. If this is the last gig anyone here attends for the foreseeable, it’s quite a way to go out.\n",

      "Text: Gone, for the time being, is the staticky hush of an expectant crowd at an old-school gig. Cancelled, too, is the wider tour Laura Marling would have undertaken in support of her seventh album, Song for Our Daughter. Instead, the British singer-songwriter takes to the stage of a deserted Union Chapel with only five camerapeople, a handful of sound crew and a skeleton venue staff for company. According to Marling’s representatives, 4,000 tickets have been sold – a figure that would have filled this atmospheric venue four times over and then some. (A second gig follows, pretty much the same set all over again, geo-fenced for US fans.) The camera finds Marling almost casually. She is a pale, white-blond figure in an oatmeal polo neck and faded jeans, lit by halogen footlights and a few candles. Standing at the microphone, guitar in hand, her full-body pallor is gradually revealed to be in painterly contrast with the rich, three-dimensional dusk of the venue.    No beer will be spilt; no one will fall in love with a stranger. You can’t even shout requests because the comments are disabled    It all looks sumptuous – emphatically not like wobbly mobile phone footage from someone’s kitchen, the “gigs” that fans have been surviving on in lockdown. One immediate upside of the careful, circling camerawork is being able to see Marling – whose dextrous, fluid musicianship doesn’t get the kudos it deserves – play her guitar up close. Later, director Giorgio Testi will use multiple distant camera angles to film Marling against the fading light streaming in through the stained glass above the nave. With no preamble, Marling begins a suite of four songs from her 2013 album, Once I Was an Eagle, which deal forensically with leave-takings and foundering love. In one of her regular guitar tutorials from lockdown, Marling explained that she wrote these songs as one meditative 10-minute salvo. It has become her go-to opening for solo acoustic gigs. It works: the exhilarating run up the frets that Marling’s fingers take on Take the Night Off creates the rush of liftoff. Strange as it seems, initially this is a show that does not lack for emotional heft. The guitar turbulence also hints at the roiling going on beneath the alabaster surface of her delivery.     ‘It all looks sumptuous’: Laura Marling at the Union Chapel. Photograph: Lorne Thomson/Redferns    This gig’s hyper-focused stage management might not work for a different kind of artist – there’s little room for wild catharsis here – but it does, in spades, for Marling. There has long been something of a stiff upper lip to her – a very English reserve with which she has conveyed tales of passion from a kind of deep freeze. This setting allows her to perform her songs with perfect control, creating an atmosphere broken only for a moment when a roadie hands Marling a guitar for What He Wrote. She only makes eye contact with the camera briefly, a few songs from the end, on Goodbye England; later, there is a brief half-smile. Moreover, such a successful staging points forward to a potentially key source of income for artists starved of touring cash. There is such an optimism to this gig: that if you build a special show, the fans will come, and pay £12 for a virtual night out (plus a discretionary donation, split between Refuge and the Trussell Trust). Clearly, no beer will be spilt; no one will fall in love with a stranger. You can’t even shout requests because the comments are disabled. Ultimately, Marling herself makes this an event worth tuning into. Her output just seems to get better and better, even as her songs ape obvious sources more and more openly: Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan, a little Leonard Cohen.   Related: Laura Marling: Song for Our Daughter review – better than ever    Unlike many releases, which lockdown pushed back, the drop of Marling’s latest album, Song for Our Daughter, was pulled forward to April from August; there was little point, she felt, in sitting on it. It followed a break in which Marling wrote original music for Peaky Blinders and collaborated with theatre director Robert Icke on his production of Mary Stuart. A previous album interlude found Marling becoming a yoga teacher. She is currently studying for a master’s in psychoanalysis. All of this searching comes to some kind of a head on these newest tracks, four of which form a mid-set suite of their own, denuded of their album orchestrations but still gleaming. Marling’s writing, never obvious, takes on a fresh maturity here: Fortune tells of a woman’s secret stash of cash, in case she ever needed to run. Best of all, Held Down is not the final song, but it is the peak of the set, another tale of leave-taking whose melody almost swaggers. When this most retro of trailblazers leaves, it’s with as little fuss as she began.           Watch a short film for Song for Our Daughter \n",

      "Headline: Jubilant britpop sweeps away years of hurt\n",
      "Text: Although Ian Broudie will always be most associated with Three Lions, the football national anthem, there’s more to him than Euro 96-era bittersweet triumphalism. His band Lightning Seeds provided the Britpop era with some of its most jubilant yet affecting lysergic pop anthems, while the Liverpudlian’s impact as producer stretches from Echo and the Bunnymen to the Fall, the Zutons to the Coral. However, a series of personal hammer blows, including his brother’s suicide, took him away from music for a decade. Ahead of a new Lightning Seeds album, this tour celebrates the youthful 61-year old’s best-known band, but the 24-song setlist goes back to his 1983 group, Care. With a new, mixed-gender Seeds – some look so young the gig may well be past their bedtime – there’s nothing, understandably, from 2009’s mesmeric but heartbreaking Four Winds. Instead, 1994’s smash album Jollification is performed in its entirety, the track listing cleverly rearranged so that the crowd are on their feet by Change and Lucky You. The second “greatest hits” set sees the band stretch their wings, reinventing Sweetest Soul Sensations on banks of soulful voices and transforming the Byrds’ You Showed Me, a Seeds smash from 1997, from lilting reggae to psychedelic dub. The elfin mop-topped frontman is endearingly rubbish at crowd banter. “I don’t know what to say,” he confesses. “Come arrrrn Ian” someone bellows, to which he fires back “I’m going as fast as I can!” But by now Broudie is on a personal pop odyssey, careering from Sense’s giddy devotional love song brilliance (“When you’re near it all makes sense”) to Pure’s perfect pop and a gorgeous a cappella rendition of the Ronettes’ Be My Baby. The Match of the Day-associated The Life of Riley and inevitable Three Lions predictably generate scenes reminiscent of the Last Night of the Proms. However, there’s a lovely moment when the music hushes as Broudie sings a slightly updated “all these years of hurt have never stopped me dreaming”, a line written about football failure which seems to sing to his life. • At St Luke’s, Glasgow, 13 March. Then touring.\n",

      "Text: Caroline Polachek poses enigmatically against a backdrop projection of a wrought-iron gate that recalls some piece of misplaced Maleficent scenery. “This is the last show we might be at for a long time, so let’s make it a good one,” she grins, a couple of tracks into her set. Polachek’s show at London’s most famous railway arch – the club Heaven – reveals itself to be both a good one and a slight disappointment. This has little to do with Polachek’s own bravura performance – slick, clever, committed – and everything to do with some giddily raised expectations of the US pop auteur. Although she was previously in a band, Chairlift, whose song, Bruises, was ubiquitous in 2008 thanks to an iPod Nano ad, Polachek never became a household name. But a few years on from Chairlift’s 2016 demise, and a couple of projects into a solo career, Polachek now forms part of a recherché club of international art pop operatives who dance on the edge of mainstream fame. It’s not about the really big names – although the stars do line up to praise Polachek. Lady Gaga put the Manhattan-born singer’s So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings on her recent International Women’s Day playlist. (Taylor Swift included the song Door.) Polachek’s song The Gate is on Grimes’s “fetal sync” pregnancy playlist too.    Pang’s suite of sad, arty alt-bangers are here in all their synthetic glory    More pertinently, Polachek’s solo album Pang exists in a delicious tension with Charli XCX’s Charli, also released in 2019. Both singers are also writers; females who are conventionally strong pop vocalists, but want to do borderline avant garde things inside a notionally undemanding genre. And the personnel on both albums all know each other. You get the feeling that a plan is still unfolding. Charli was produced by AG Cook, previously of maverick London pop disrupters PC Music. Pang was produced by PCM alumnus Danny L Harle; a house in Los Angeles used by both camps figured in the writing of the album. So Charli XCX’s verdict on Pang came as little surprise, but was not far off the mark: “top to tail perfection”, she called it. Even more germane, in the last fortnight, Polachek has been involved in other international grown-up pop happenings – as the featured guest on Christine and the Queens’ excellent recent EP, La Vita Nuova. In the short film that accompanied the CATQ release, Polachek becomes a victim to the red-eyed Héloïse Letissier’s vampiric desires. Days before tonight’s gig, Polachek joined Christine and the Queens on stage for a duet in a tiny east London club to mark the release. Not long before that, Polachek played her own deconstructed solo gig in a church for Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac’s AMP festival. Those stripped-back versions of Pang’s songs – on Chinese hammered dulcimer, electric upright bass and digital mellotron – were notable precisely because Pang was one of last year’s most hyper-produced pop offerings. So if Polachek remains a little niche, that feeling is changing, and not before time. Tunes like So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings are hugely influenced by the big vamps of 80s AOR as much as they are by digital mischief. When it comes tonight, the song sounds like an era-mulching banger artificially rendered bonsai by being played in a too-small venue. Less excitingly, Polachek covers the Corrs’ Breathless tonight, which is perhaps an art prank too far.           Watch the video for So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings by Caroline Polachek    All this notwithstanding, tonight’s gig proceeds by the book – and given all that has recently preceded it, that constitutes just the merest of let-downs. Letissier does not make a return special guest appearance. No one goes nuts on a hammered Chinese dulcimer. Nothing is stripped back in any conventional sense – apart from one song, Look at Me Now, which finds Polachek playing guitar alongside her sole bandmate, the multi-instrumentalist Blu DeTiger on bass, largely unaided by electronics. The crowd yell out one of the most personal lines – “girl, you’re getting skinny” – a concern in the song voiced by Polachek’s friends, as the singer processed the end of her two-year marriage and began anew. (Polachek sometimes models, but Pang serves as reassurance that even very beautiful people can be very articulate about being very sad.) The sole bit of lily-gilding tonight is a guest appearance by Harle, who joins Polachek in the encore to big cheers. On Parachute, a song about taking risks, he triggers the song’s digital atmospherics. Shortly afterwards, he ruins her concentration by triggering a loud hip-hop producer tag of “Caroline Polachek!”. One new pop song called Smoke – “we wrote this yesterday” – points enticingly forwards, as Polachek, Harle and the bassist on backing vocals trade beats with “na, na, nas”.     Caroline Polachek at Heaven, London Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer    The rest of the night remains all about Pang’s suite of sad, arty alt-bangers in all their original synthetic glory: reverberating bass, snickety hi-hats, mostly ersatz, all delicious. She plays nothing from her Chairlift days, or from her other previous projects, Ramona Lisa and CEP. But the DJ’s pre-gig playlist of wall-to-wall Cocteau Twins points up the sophisticated nature of what is actually going on in Polachek’s music, which still bears examination. Even though her vocals on the album sound treated, Polachek is blessed with an innately processed-sounding vocal ability. Tonight, she trills, swoons and delivers both Arabic intonations and Liz Fraser-like melismas on songs like Insomnia with little, if any, digital assistance, slaying the high notes, faintly recalling that other great wind generator of contemporary pop, Florence and the Machine, on Ocean of Tears. Not only that, but the songs sound as strong as you remember them. Even The Gate, which seemed initially as an introductory passage, sounds profound tonight. “We will be okay/ cause finally there’s a way to be both free and safe,” Polachek exhales.\n",
